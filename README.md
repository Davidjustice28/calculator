# calculator
This was the final project for the Odin project foundation course. A simple calculator with a few functions.

In this project, I tried to bring together all my current skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
My skills in CSS have definitely improved and the design of the calculator was easy. However the functionality aspect was very hard.
I gave myself 3 days and was able to get to where it is in less than 2 days. 

Currently there are 3 issues which I am continiously working on.
